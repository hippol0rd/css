				<h1>A testimonial from thresh "hippo" in the box</h1>
				<p>
					"Well if you really want to know what it's like to play with these teams, you gotta imagine you are running in a race, a relay with four other people. You're the fastest team around, on a good day you can't be beat, you are simply the best. But every race day something goes wrong, someone gets hurts, the baton, you just always seem to lose, even when you're winning. Thats League with the boys..." <cite>hippol0rd</cite>

				<h3>Legendary Rengo</h3>

					<h1>The 2BRO Mission Statement</h1>
					<p>
						Mission: 2BRO aims to the best, the very best, like no one ever was. To beat them all is our real test, to wreck them is our cause. We will travel across the internet, searching far and wide. Teach dumb noobs to understand, the power we supply.
					</p>
					<p>

						Vision: Usually lacking in our League games because we don't know how to ward effectively.

					<H3>The 2BRO Mentality:</H3>
					<p>The 2BRO boys have been established as a clan for over 10 years, spanning several consoles, games, and members over the decades. Although 2BRO has changed throughout its journey since conception, one thing remains constant, Win or Lose; GGEZ.</p>
